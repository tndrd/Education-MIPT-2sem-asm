# Second semester programming tasks in MIPT.
- **DOS/Ramka:** simple DOS graphical program written in assembly.
- **DOS/Ramka/Registers:** resident program that uses 09h DOS interrupt and shows registers values on screen when button is pressed.
- **DOS/HackMe:** app that asks password. Hack it if you can!
- **Printf:** systemV printf-like assembly function, that may be called from c/c++.
- **HackEgor:** remember "HackMe"? This is a password generator and GUI crack-program for breaking through [similar program](https://github.com/Krym4s/passhack).
- **Mandelbrot:** program that draws Mandelbrot set. Its different versions use SSE/AVX/FMA instructions or none of them. Finally the performance of these instructions can be compared. 
- **HashTable:** hash-table implementation and its subsequent optimization. See more in [article](https://github.com/tndrd/Education-MIPT-2sem-asm/tree/main/HashTable).
